# Income Prediction of a Dating App's Users

The notebook, `dating-app.ipynb`, presents how I applied supervised machine learning (ML) models to predict 'income' of users of a dating app called OKCupid. The objective of the project was to find the best model out of several selected models: linear regression, negative binomial regression, gamma regression, and XGBoost regression. The dataset was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).
