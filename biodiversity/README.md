# Biodiversity EDA

Note: this project is part of my study of data science on [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com) and is based on their guideline and other given resources. The data is provided by them and fictional.

The notebook (`biodiversity.ipynb`) presents exploratory data analysis about endangered species across different national parks in the USA. Here we have two datasets: `species_info.csv` and `observations.csv`, they are provided by the National Parks Service and contain information mainly about conservation status of each listed species and the number of observations for each species across national parks.
